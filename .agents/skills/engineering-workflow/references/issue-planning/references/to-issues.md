# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable issues using vertical slices (tracer bullets).

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes an issue reference (issue number, URL, or path) as an argument, fetch it from GitHub Issues using `mcp_GitHub_get_issue` and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state. Issue titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' (require human interaction) or 'AFK' (can be implemented without human interaction). Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

Rules:

- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right?
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the issues to GitHub

For each approved slice, publish a new issue using `mcp_GitHub_create_issue`. Use the issue body template below. Publish issues in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real issue identifiers in the "Blocked by" field.

## Issue Template

```md
## Parent

A reference to the parent issue (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit).

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- A reference to the blocking ticket (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.
